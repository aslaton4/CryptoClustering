# CryptoClustering

### This project required us to apply K-Means clustering to a dataset of cryptocurrency market changes. We were required to utilize both raw scaled data and PCA data. The objective was to analyze how reducing dimensionality impacts clustering efficiency and accuracy. 

### Key Aspects/Takeaways:
- The dataset was normalized using StandardScaler to ensure all features contributed equally to clustering. 
- The original scaled data suggested an optimal k = 4 and in my opion the PCA suggested the same.
